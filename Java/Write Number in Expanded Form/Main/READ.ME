Write Number in Expanded Form
You will be given a number and you will need to return it as a string in Expanded Form. For example:

expandedForm(12)    --> should return "10 + 2"
expandedForm(42)    --> should return "40 + 2"
expandedForm(70304) --> should return "70000 + 300 + 4"
NOTE: All numbers will be whole numbers greater than 0.
